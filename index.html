    <h1 class="highlight">Hi! I am Tom.</h1>
    <p>This website will show you what I have learned in Graphic And Web Design Studio.</p>
    <h2>CARP Posters</h2>
    <img src="IMG_1748.jpg" alt="Bad Poster" class="center">
    <p>This is the poster that I made! The design is inspired by an animation that I like, which is called Bad Apple, they both made in black and white. This poster is drawn with Sketchbook, because I really don't know how to make these with Adobe Illustrator. =(</p>
    <h2 class="handwriting">Typography</h2> 
    <p>In my understanding, typography is a form of art of texts, the quality of this kind of art will determine the reader's experience by the text's appearence, like changing the size of the texts, changing the distance of each line of texts, or even curving the texts to make them look like a drawing! Unfortunlately, I only undertand the concept but don't know how to express them with Adobe Illustrator. =(</p>
    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>This website basically shows everythings I know how to code in HTML, it's definity not much, but it still can be enough. </p>

    <p>I learned how to change the texts' size, change the background color and insert the images in a website called https://www.w3schools.com, which is really helpful for me! </p>

    <p>I learned how to resize my images in my website from YouTube!</p>
    <h2>My Reflection Essay</h2>
    <p>In this semester, I have learnt a lot of computing stuff from the four modules.  One of the modules is Graphic and Web Design Studio, which is mainly about creating a website that suits its users.</p>
    <p>At the start of the semester, it introduced us to several websites or software, like Miro, Git and GitHub.  At the start, I really did not know what they do, or I even never heard of them.  After spending some time using them, I finally can get a hold of them, thus they can help me to design my artwork as well as create my website.</p>
    <p>Moreover, we actually have learnt a lot about art theory and design, which is quite out of my expectation, rather than just learning about computing.  For example, this module delivered a lot about colour theory, such as which type of colour will make the viewers feel the heat or what kind of colour will make them feel chill.  This is explained through colour temperature.  Taking to the next level, colour combination is also an interesting topic to me.  There are plenty of colour combinations, such as monochromatic, analogous complementary, split complementary, triadic and tetradic.  Each of these colour combinations can make the viewers have different feelings.  It made me realise how colour can manipulate oneâ€™s emotions.  Designers can make good use of it to let the viewers have a better experience.  In my website, the CARP poster shown there is inspired by a YouTube video and the complementary colour combination. </p>
    <p>Another topic that I learnt from this module is typography.  There are many typographic systems, such as axial, radial, dilatational, random, grid, modular, transitional and bilateral.  Each of them has its different kind of appearance, expression of texts.  However, I do think typography is an area that is subjective and flexible and yet difficult to manage.  To me, the above-mentioned colour combination is much easier.  This is mainly because there are so many parameters to tune, like the font size, font family, kerning, weight and more.  Even worse, I have to mind about the readability while tuning the parameters.  After all, you cannot just adjust the fonts as if it is a big picture.  Instead, each character is a small picture, and a phase or even a word is a collection of small pictures.  If I am to be a designer, I will be more towards the readability of the slogans shown in posters rather than the creativity.  When I put my feets in the shoes of the viewers, I believe the most important aspect is what message I pick up from the poster.  Of course, different posters may have different goals, and hence, creativity may bear a more important role.</p>
    <p>The computing aspects in this module are coding HTML and CSS.  It did recommend us to reference ideas from a must-go-to website called W3schools (www.w3schools.com) when building this website.  It serves as an online tutorial, a cookbook and a reference book to me.  It also provides exercises to solidify my knowledge.  Beyond these, it teaches many other programming languages, which may be useful in future.  I learnt some javascript coding from it.  Furthermore, I also watch YouTube videos for building my website since it basically have every piece of knowledge you can access as long as you know how to ask or find.</p>
    <p>In short, I believe this module lets me have more knowledge and a better understanding in digital art design and website building.</p>
