    <h3>^ This is the poster that I made! The design is inspired by an animation that I like, which is called Bad Apple, they both made in black and white. This poster is drawn with Sketchbook, because I really don't know how to make these with Adobe Illustrator. =(</h3>
    <h1>Typography</h1> 
    <h3>In my understanding, typography is a form of art of texts, the quality of this kind of art will determine the reader's experience by the text's appearence, like changing the size of the texts, changing the distance of each line of texts, or even curving the texts to make them look like a drawing! Unfortunlately, I only undertand the concept but don't know how to express them with Adobe Illustrator. =(</h3>
