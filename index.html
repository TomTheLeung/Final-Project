    <h1>Hi! I am Tom. 
        A nerd who likes playing games, especially games that contain 
        stories, lore and different endings. I always love going for an 
        adventure that can't be experienced in my real life, and perhaps these
        journeys can inspire me to make my own one, regardless if it's in 
        fiction or real world.
